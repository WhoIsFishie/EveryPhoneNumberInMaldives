# EveryPhoneNumberInMaldives
Generator and List of every possible phone number in maldives

## HOW DO I USE THIS LIST
Well you can setup an android vm and download one of the .vcf files and import that or push the contact2.db file really up to you how you do it
for setting up android vm 8gb storage was not enough so i allocated 32GB and for ram i gave it 5GB to make it run fast
with 5GB of ram i managed to add 1million numbers within about 12 hours.

### C number gen
This is better then C# code except you have to rename the file yourself and in theory should be the fastest Csv gen in this repo.

### Batch Number Gen
I thought it would be funny to add to the list.

### Android_App
Contains the base code needed to make the contacts gen. you will need to asemble the code yourself all the pieces are there.

### C# number gen
I left in the raw code. you will need to make a project and throw it in there and hit run.

### Csv output
This is the csv files for anyone who's too lazy to generate the list themself. \
The list is split into 2 parts. Ooredoo and Dhiraagu.

### Vcf Output
This contains the csv which got converted into VCards. same as the csv this is also split into 2 parts.
